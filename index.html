        <p><b> Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science dedicated to creating systems capable of performing
                tasks
                that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include learning, reasoning, problem-solving,
                perception, and language understanding. AI is built on the foundation of algorithms, which are sets of
                rules
                that instruct computers on how to perform specific tasks. There are several subfields within AI,
                including
                machine learning, where systems improve their performance by learning from data, and deep learning, a
                more
                advanced form of machine learning that mimics the neural networks of the human brain. AI is utilized in
                various applications such as virtual assistants, autonomous vehicles, medical diagnosis, and financial
                forecasting. One of the most prominent examples of AI is in natural language processing (NLP), which
                allows
                machines to understand and respond to human language. AI systems like chatbots and recommendation
                engines
                are already a part of our daily lives, enhancing user experiences and efficiency. Despite its many
                advantages, AI also presents challenges, including ethical considerations, job displacement, and the
                need
                for significant computational resources. Researchers and policymakers are actively working to address
                these
                issues to ensure that AI technologies are developed and deployed responsibly. The potential of AI is
                vast,
                promising innovations in fields as diverse as healthcare, education, and entertainment. As AI continues
                to
                evolve, it holds the promise of transforming industries and creating new opportunities while posing
                questions about the future of work and human-machine interaction. In essence, AI represents a
                significant
                leap forward in technology,<br> with the potential to reshape our world in profound ways, making it a
                crucial area of study and development in the 21st century.</b></p>

    <h3 align="center">What is AI?</h3>
    <p><b>

            Artificial intelligence, or AI, is technology that enables computers and machines to simulate human
            intelligence and problem-solving capabilities.

            On its own or combined with other technologies (e.g., sensors, geolocation, robotics) AI can perform tasks
            that would otherwise require human intelligence or intervention. Digital assistants, GPS guidance,
            autonomous vehicles, and generative AI tools (like Open AI's Chat GPT) are just a few examples of AI in the
            daily news and our daily lives.

            As a field of computer science, artificial intelligence encompasses (and is often mentioned together with)
            machine learning and deep learning. These disciplines involve the development of AI algorithms, modeled
            after the decision-making processes of the human brain, that can ‘learn’ from available data and make
            increasingly more accurate classifications or predictions over time.

            Artificial intelligence has gone through many cycles of hype, but even to skeptics, the release of ChatGPT
            seems to mark a turning point. The last time generative AI loomed this large, the breakthroughs were in
            computer vision, but now the leap forward is in natural language processing (NLP). Today, generative AI can
            learn and synthesize not just human language but other data types including images, video, software code,
            and even molecular structures.

            Applications for AI are growing every day. But as the hype around the use of AI tools in business takes off,
            conversations around ai ethics and responsible ai become critically important. For more on where IBM stands
            on these issues, please read Building trust in AI.
